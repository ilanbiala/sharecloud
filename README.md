# sharecloud

 Ideas:

 - Make it centered more around the dj playing, not the users
 - Many already exist (dubtrack.fm, juqster.com, dj.duomi.com, formerly plug.dj, soundtrack.io, etc.), but none have an option of mixing sounds/adding filters and effects/downloading the songs, etc. We will make the same thing, but make the dj be able to control different features (like what filter/crossfading/etc.)

TODO:

 - Make it

Can use:

 - SoundManager 2 (http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/)
 - Can use howler.js (http://goldfirestudios.com/blog/104/howler.js-Modern-Web-Audio-Javascript-Library)

 Domain options:
 
 - sharecloud.* (.ml for now), tim34.party
